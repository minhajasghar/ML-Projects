# ML Projects 🚀  

This repository contains various Machine Learning projects that I have worked on. Each project includes datasets, code, and relevant reports.  

## 📂 Projects Included:  
1. **Heart Disease Prediction** 🫀  
   - A classification model to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms.  
   - Located in the `Heart Disease Prediction` folder.  

2. **Phish Guard (Phishing URL Detection)** 🔗🛡️  
   - A machine learning model to classify URLs as **Safe** or **Phishing**.  
   - Uses NLP and feature extraction techniques for accurate detection.  
   - Located in the `Phish Guard Model` folder.  

3. **Student Performance Prediction** 🎓📊  
   - A regression model that predicts students' **exam scores** based on input features like study time, parental education, and past performance.  
   - Uses **Linear Regression** for prediction.  
   - Located in the `Student_Performance_Prediction` folder.  

More projects will be added soon! Stay tuned.
